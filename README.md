# KuKa Metal Plate Scans from Rothera

This repository contains data and plots corresponding to scans of a 121 x 81 cm metal plate. The scans were performed in the aircraft hanger, with kuka mounted on its transect sled with its shock absorbers. The plate was scanned sequentially by the horns, meaning that it was centered under one horn using a plumb bob, scanned, then re-centered under the other horn and rescanned. The concrete floor was brushed clear of snow prior to the plate being positioned, such that the plate was as flat as possible.

In position, the distance from the Ku horn rim to the plate (measured with the folding ruler) was 141.1 cm. The distance from the lower edge of the black plastic arm was 157.3 cm. The corresponding distances for the Ka-band antenna are 149.1 cm and 159.7 cm.
